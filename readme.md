## A project created by a team of 3 students from CPSC 304 in UBC. 
# The student's names are: Khammy, Adi, and Jonathan.

Our project is a job/volunteer board that centers around advertising campus organizations and their opportunities while allowing students to apply for student club/organization positions that are posted by other students. Event logistics and volunteering opportunities are also included in the domain. Students can upload their personal information as well as post their own position/volunteer openings. We aim to centralize the search for campus opportunities.
